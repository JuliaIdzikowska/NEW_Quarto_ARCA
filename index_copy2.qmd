## Running code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
head(rock)
```

```{r}
data = read.csv("~/Desktop/QUARTO/NEW_Quarto_ARCA/data/dataset.csv")

#chunk 1
head(data)

#chunk 1
str(data)

#chunk 3 
summary(data)

```


When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
